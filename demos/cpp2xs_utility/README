Note that src/FastSieve.cpp is basically a copy of the code included in FastSieve.pm in David Oswald's
Math-Prime-FastSieve-0.13 source distro.
The only change is that the "Sieve" class has been renamed to "_Sieve" to accommodate the
--export_ok_all option (which places all functions that don't begin with a single underscore into @EXPORT_OK).

Similarly - the 't' folder is basically a copy of the 't' folder from the same distro.
Both t/01can_subs.t and t/03sieve_object.t have been altered to accommodate the renaming of the class
from "Sieve" to "_Sieve". (No other changes were made.)

Having installed InlineX::CPP2XS (version 0.20 or later), if you 'cd' to the folder that contains this file and:

1) run cpp2xs --m=Math::Prime::FastSieve --write_makefile_pl=1 --write_pm=1 --manif=1 --version=0.13 --export_ok_all=1
2) Run 'perl Makefile.PL' and 'make test'

then you will have built Math-Prime-FastSieve-0.13 such that it has no dependency on Inline::CPP.
(Nothing more ... nothing less :-)

Also, to extend the demo:

1) run cpp2xs --m=Math::Prime::FastSieve --dist=1 --version=0.13 --export_ok_all=1 --bd=./mybuild
2) 'cd' to the './mybuild' folder
3) Run 'perl Makefile.PL' and 'make test'

Again, you will have built Math-Prime-FastSieve-0.13 such that it has no dependency on Inline::CPP.
But this time you'll have created a *portable* Makefile.PL that should work across different OS/Compiler
combos. (The Makefile.PL that was written in the first example will likely not work for different OS/Compiler
combos.)
