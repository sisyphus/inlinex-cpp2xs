Inherit.xs, Inherit.pm, Makefile.PL, INLINE.h and CPP.map were produced by
cd'ing to this (ie demos/cpp) directory and running the following one liner:

perl -MInlineX::CPP2XS -e "InlineX::CPP2XS::cpp2xs('Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC::Inherit', 'main',  '.', {WRITE_MAKEFILE_PL => 1, VERSION => 0.11, WRITE_PM => 1})"

The assumption is that you're using 'g++' as your cpp compiler. If that's not
the case then you need to amend the CC entry in the above command appropriately.

That one liner is as run in a typical Windows shell. For a typical nix shell you'll
need to interchange the double-quotes and the single-quotes.

For the purposes of providing a complete example of what is needed, I've
also included, in this directory (ie 'demos/cpp'), a MANIFEST, a README (this file)
and a test file (test.pl).

Probably worth removing Inherit.pm, Inherit.xs, Makefile.PL, CPP.map and INLINE.h,
then running the above one liner for yourself - just to verify that everything
works properly for you.

Then simply run:

perl Makefile.PL
make test

You've now created, from the C++ code in demos/cpp/src/Inherit.cpp, a normal
module that has no dependence on Inline.

You would even be able to then successfully run 'make install' - though,
given that this module doesn't really do anything useful, I don't know why
anyone would want to install it. It's also quite ludicrous to be creating
Inherit.pm in the Math::Geometry::Planar::GPC namespace.
