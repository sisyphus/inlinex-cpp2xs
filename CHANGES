- 0.25 ... Add 'T' config option.

           Add metadata to InlineX::CPP2XS Makefile.PL.

           Escape "{" and "}" in regex at line 165 of t/t_makefile_pl.t

- 0.24 ... In t/t_portability.t and t/t_prehead.t change all occurrences of '__INLINE_CPP'
           to '__INLINE_CPP_' (to distinguish the pattern being sought from the defining
           of __INLINE_CPP that was created in Inline-CPP-0.40).

- 0.23 ... "eval $VERSION;" in the created PM file - as per current recommendations
           Fix typo in Makefile.PL. (Change "Test::warn" to "Test::Warn".) Thanks Davido.

- 0.22 ... Remove remove_dup function. (Simpler to override $Inline::CPP::Config::flavor_defs.)

- 0.21 ... Add the capability of writing a portable Makefile.PL.

           Add the capability of writing a MANIFEST file (that includes all of the
           generated files).

           Add 'DIST' config option.

           Require Inline-0.50 and Inline-CPP-0.39. (Had been 0.45 and 0.25 respectively.)

- 0.20 ... Fix LIBS setting. Was clobbering any value set by Inline::CPP::validate().

           Add the demos/cpp2xs_utility demo.

- 0.19 ... Add CCFLAGSEX, BOOT_F and PRE_HEAD options

           Add cpp2xs.pl (which generates the cpp2xs script)

           If EXPORT_TAGS_ALL is set, then it's now unnecessary to set
           EXPORT_OK_ALL

- 0.17 ... Add PREREQ_PM config option

           Rewrite t_autowrap_cpp.t, t_code.t, t_cpp.t, t_hello.t, t_makefile_pl.t
           and t_src_location.t to accommodate recent (and hopefully future) changes
           to the layout of generated code.

           Remove 'expected.h', 'expected_cpp.txt', 'expected_autowrap.txt',
           'expected_autowrap_c.txt', 'expected_hello.txt' and 'expected_typemap.txt'
           as these are no longer used.

- 0.16 ... Add config option 'USE'

           Substitution regex added to t_makefile_pl.t - to cater for recent ActivePerls

           Cater for the possibility that we're including iostream (not iostream.h) in
           the test scripts

- 0.15 ... Add config options EXPORT_ALL, EXPORT_OK_ALL and EXPORT_TAGS_ALL

           Add newline at the bottom of src/test.alt (as per requirements of a valid
           C/CPP source file).

           'USING' (which is useless with Inline::CPP and InlineX::CPP2XS anyway)
           now takes either a string or array reference as its value (as does
           the Inline::C equivalent).

           'LIBS' and 'TYPEMAPS' can now optionally be assigned as a (space
           delimited) string or an array reference (same as 'INC'). Previously
           'LIBS' and 'TYPEMAPS' had to be assigned as an array reference.

           'INC' (in generated Makefile.PL) no longer automatically includes the cwd.

           'TYPEMAPS' (in generated Makefile.PL) no longer automatically specifies
           the standard perl typemap. (Doing so was annoying and, afaict, unnecessary.)

           Add Inline-0.45 to PREREQ_PM.

- 0.13 ... Change the test for the locatability of a specified typemap from a
           '-e' test to a '-f' test.

           Add CPP2XS-Cookbook.pod.

           Minor change to WRITE_PM.

           The CPP source code can now be alternatively provided by either a
           'CODE' or 'SRC_LOCATION' key.

- 0.12 ... Provide access to ParseRegExp.pm. (Untested, because ParseRegExp.pm
           is broken - see http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6327 for
           patches to ParseRegExp.pm)

           Can now write a .pm file for you as well

- 0.11 ... Can now provide the optional "4th" (config options) argument
           without *also* having to provide a "3rd" (build directory) argument.
           ie If the third argument is a hash reference, it's assumed to contain
           config options - otherwise it sets the build directory.

           Check that only valid config options have been passed via the "config
           options" argument.

           Catch the error (and die) if a non-existent typemap is specified
           in the TYPEMAPS config option.

           If the specified build_dir does not exist, die(). Previously, a warning was
           issued and the files written to the current working directory.

- 0.10 ... Module is now called InlineX::CPP2XS (previously Inline::CPP2XS, which is now
           deprecated).
           Now has the same capabilities as its C counterpart (InlineX::C2XS-0.10) -
           ie can also (optionally) autogenerate the Makefile.PL in addition to the other
           files it has always been capable of generating (namely the .xs file, INLINE.h
           and CPP.map).

- 0.07 ... Inline::CPP2XS born (previously part of Inline::C2XS)
